				The improvements over the previous version are:</FONT></P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="justify"><FONT size="2"><STRONG>execution speed</STRONG>: depending on the 
							machine and the number of clusters in the image, the tracking time is reduced 
							by a factor ranging from 4 through 10.</FONT></DIV>
				</LI>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="justify"><FONT size="2"><STRONG>multiprocessor support</STRONG>: the 
							tracking task can be split over several processors, thus reducing 
							proportionally the tracking time.</FONT></DIV>
				</LI>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="justify"><FONT size="2"><STRONG>double reconstruction cleanup</STRONG>: the 
							cleanup procedure has been improved, so in crowdy conditions SmartTracker4 
							returns fewer doubly reconstructed tracks.</FONT></DIV>
				</LI>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="justify"><FONT size="2"><STRONG>tracking speed estimation tool</STRONG>: a 
							simple tool to estimate tracking speed is embedded with this module.</FONT></DIV>

			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">SmartTracker4 can use more than one processor if they 
					are available: several tracking threads can work together, each one finding 
					tracks on one region of the volume.</FONT></P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">The basic concept is still to recognize tracks by 
					means of the quality of alignment. Random associations of grains should be 
					poorly aligned, whereas good tracks should be regular paths of well aligned 
					grains. However, since the Z axis (focal axis) is sampled in coarse granularity 
					(2 µm usually), the uncertainty in the depth position of each grain is much 
					larger than the <IMG alt="" src="HelpTracking.gif" align="left">transverse 
					errors (usually of the order of&nbsp;0.3 µm). For almost "vertical" track, a 
					single alignment tolerance is enough, but as the track becomes more and more 
					skewed, the uncertainty in Z has dramatic effects on alignment along the 
					direction of the horizontal projection of the slope; in the transverse 
					direction, the alignment is still quite good. In the picture, the blue marks 
					show how much the projected position of a grain can vary as it moves along a 
					track (grey line) with the sampling layers marked in red. In general, when 
					searching for grains that are aligned with a track with slope <STRONG>(S<SUB>x</SUB>, 
						S<SUB>y</SUB>)</STRONG>, and an alignment tolerance as large as <STRONG>a</STRONG>, 
					and a sampling step between layers as large as <STRONG>d<SUB>z</SUB></STRONG>, 
					the&nbsp;acceptance area is an ellipse&nbsp;with the&nbsp;major axis oriented 
					as the projection of the slope, as large as <IMG src="HelpAcceptance.gif" align="absMiddle" Set>, 
					and the minor axis as large as <STRONG>a</STRONG>.</FONT></P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">Testing all possible track slopes would be very slow. 
					In order to speed up tracking, SmartTracker4 uses <EM>triggers</EM>. It picks 
					two grains in different layers, and checks whether there is an aligned grain 
					within; if so, this is assumed as a sign that the three grains are possibly 
					part of a track, and then SmartTracker4 starts looking for other grains in 
					other layers, by using the initial slope and position suggested by the two 
					grains; after appending grains, slope and position are properly updated.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT size="2">A 
					trigger is defined as&nbsp;(L<SUB>u</SUB>, L<SUB>d</SUB>, L<SUB>l</SUB>) where 
					L<SUB>u</SUB> and L<SUB>d</SUB> are respectively the upper and lower layer 
					numbers where to pick grains for guessing the initial position and slope, and L<SUB>l</SUB>
					is a list of layer numbers enclosed within L<SUB>u</SUB> and L<SUB>d</SUB> where 
					at list one aligned grain must be found in order to start up with track 
					formation. For example,&nbsp;</FONT><FONT size="2">let's suppose that the user 
					has set two triggers, which we call T<SUB>1</SUB> and T<SUB>2</SUB>, defined as 
					follows:</FONT></P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">T<SUB>1 </SUB>= (2, 14, (5, 7, 9) )</FONT></P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">T<SUB>2 </SUB>= (3, 13, (6, 10) )</FONT></P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">Then SmartTracker4 will begin with T<SUB>1</SUB>, 
					combine the grains in layers 2 and 14, and for each pair it will look for an 
					aligned grain in layers 5, 7, and 9; if any of these layers "fires" with an 
					aligned grain, then SmartTrack will start looking for aligned grains in all 
					other layers; after examining the layers suggested by T<SUB>1</SUB>, 
					SmartTracker will use the hint provided by T<SUB>2</SUB>, and repeat the 
					procedure thoroughly, using layers 3 and 13, and looking for aligned grains in 
					layers 6 and 10.</FONT></P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">When a track hint is found, SmartTracker4 searches 
					for aligned grains in all layers, even if for several layers it finds nothing. 
					Only when all layers for a track have been examined, SmartTracker decides 
					whether to keep or to reject the track, according to the number of grains it 
					has collected. We expect vertical tracks to have more grains than wide angle 
					tracks, because of the shadow effect of grains piling up. The minimum number of 
					grains depends on the track slope, and it has to be = <STRONG>n<SUB>min</SUB>(S)</STRONG>, 
					where <STRONG>S</STRONG> is the track slope, and <STRONG>n<SUB>min</SUB></STRONG>
					is defined by the formula &nbsp;<IMG alt="" src="HelpMinPtsFormula.gif" align="middle">.&nbsp;The 
					three <STRONG>n</STRONG>s in the formula are three parameters, that can be 
					fixed by requiring that the curve passes through three points. </FONT>
			</P>
			<P align="justify"><FONT size="2">After building all possible tracks, SmartTracker4 
					examines double reconstructions. If two possible tracks share one or more 
					grains, the one with fewer grains is discarded; however, discarded tracks are 
					not immediately deleted, but are still used to continue this "pruning" 
					operation, and other possible tracks are compared with these "zombie" tracks. 
					Only after iterating over all the tracks, SmartTracker4 deletes the "zombies" 
					and returns the final set. This procedure is then deterministic even in a 
					multiprocessor environment, where, on the opposite, the SmartTracker cleaning 
					procedure was deterministic only on single-processor machines, since its result 
					depended on the exact order of appearance of tracks.</FONT>
