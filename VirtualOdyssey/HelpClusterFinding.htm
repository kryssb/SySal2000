				</FONT></EM><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Once the image has been binarized, 
				finding clusters of interesting pixels (1s on&nbsp;background of 0s)&nbsp;is a 
				very well defined mathematical operation. Thus, it makes no sense to talk about 
				cluster finding efficiency.&nbsp;Missing a cluster just signals the presence of 
				a bug.</FONT>&nbsp;

		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size="2">The Odyssey clustering algorithm is 
					the usual SySal one. It also correctly handles "A-shaped clusters" and 
					"V-shaped clusters".<BR>
					For each cluster, the returned information is:</FONT></FONT></P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2"><EM>Id, Area, X, Y, InertiaXX, InertiaXY, 
					InertiaIYY.</EM></FONT></P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2"><FONT color="#ff0066">Id</FONT> is just 
				a sequential order number.<BR>
				<FONT color="#ff0066">Area</FONT> is the number of pixels that make up this 
				cluster.<BR>
				<FONT color="#ff0066">X</FONT> and <FONT color="#ff0066">Y</FONT> are the 
				cluster coordinates (measured from the center of the field of view in pixels).<BR>
				<FONT color="#ff0066">InertiaXX</FONT>, <FONT color="#ff0066">InertiaXY</FONT>, <FONT color="#ff0066">
					InertiaYY</FONT>: components of the matrix of inertia of that cluster. They 
				are only three, but&nbsp;matrix of inertia is symmetric.</FONT></P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2">In order to speed up the clustering 
				process, it can be split over several threads. The&nbsp;clustering 
				speed&nbsp;is usually proportional to the number of threads used,&nbsp;until 
				this number reaches the number of processors in the machine. Increasing the 
				number of threads over the number of processors then just increases the 
				overhead for managing multiple threads.&nbsp;Parallel clustering only works in 
				asynchronous processing mode. <FONT face="Arial" size="2">In asynchronous mode, 
					clusters for each sequence are produced after the next sequence starts, so 
					there is 1 sequence delay.</FONT></FONT></P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Clustering needs the intervention of the 
				host CPU</FONT><FONT face="Arial" size="2">. In synchronous mode, it must be so 
				fast that it stays in sync with the acquisition, and it has 1 field delay with 
				respect to grabbing end (2 field delay with respect to grabbing start). With 
				fast cameras (&gt;60 fps) this requirement is hardly met, and frames are 
				missed, also because of OS thread time slicing (10 ms under Windows). Thus, for 
				high performances, asynchronous operation is recommended. The synchronous 
				functions have been implemented just for completeness and back-compatibility 
				with older scanning modules.</FONT></P>
