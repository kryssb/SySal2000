				</FONT></EM><FONT face="Arial" size="2">The filter response is sometimes found 
				to depend on the position of an object in the field of view. This depends 
				essentially on two factors: astygmatism in the optical system and lighting 
				inhomogeneities.</FONT>
		</P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Astygmatism is sometimes detectable by 
				eye. A grain image in the center of the field of view looks much sharper than 
				when it is far from the center. Of course, part of this effect depends on 
				spherical aberration (so the focus varies from the center to the edges), but if 
				spherical aberration were the only cause, a careful refocusing would yield a 
				sharp grain image; indeed, grains far from the center can never yield sharp 
				images, and this is called astygmatism: the image of a point is not a point, 
				but a region with a shape that depends on the specific optical equipment of the 
				microscope, and on the position in the field of view. In this conditions, the 
				FIR filter response peak too has an height that depends on the position of the 
				grain in the field of view.</FONT></P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Lighting inhomogeneities, when very 
				strong, can severely affect the filter performances. Indeed, FIR filters are 
				linear filters. This means that the dynamic range of the filter output is 
				proportional to the dynamic range of the input signal. Of course, the 
				information content of a well illuminated area is larger than what a poorly 
				illuminated area can provide; the filter peaks will then be higher in the 
				illuminated areas.</FONT></P>
		<P align="justify"><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Since the filter output is to be 
				binarized, for each pixel the&nbsp;interesting information is just whether the 
				filter output&nbsp;reaches or not a certain level.&nbsp;Thus, adding a pedestal 
				image&nbsp;to the filter output can help in most cases to recover the effects 
				of astygmatism and incorrect lighting. The pedestal image varies very much, so 
				Odyssey provides no predefined utility to make&nbsp;such images. External 
				algorithms that provide these images should tailor them very carefully on the 
				specific case.</FONT></P>
